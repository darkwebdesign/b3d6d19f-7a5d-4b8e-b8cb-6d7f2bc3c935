# Form Field Types

A form is composed of fields, each of which are built with the help of a field type (e.g. `TextType`, `ChoiceType`, etc). The
Symfony Add-on Pack comes with additional field types that can be used in your application.

## Supported Field Types

The following field types are available:

### Date and Time Fields

* [BirthdayType]({% link types/birthday-type.md %})

### Other Fields

* [BooleanType]({% post_url types/boolean-type %})
* [EntityType]({% post_url types/entity-type %})
* [UnstructuredType]({% post_url types/unstructured-type %})
