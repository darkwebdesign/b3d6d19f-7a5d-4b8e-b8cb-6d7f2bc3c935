# Validation Constraints

The Symfony Validator is designed to validate objects against constraints. In real life, a constraint could be: "The cake must
not be burned". In Symfony, constraints are similar: They are assertions that a condition is true.

## Supported Constraints

The following constraints are available:

### String Constraints

* [Json]({% link constraints/json.md %})

### Number Constraints

* [Bsn]({% link constraints/bsn.md %})

### Collection Constraints

* [Collection]({% link constraints/collection.md %})
