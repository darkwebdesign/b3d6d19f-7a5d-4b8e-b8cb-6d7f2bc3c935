# Validation Constraints

The Symfony Validator is designed to validate objects against constraints. In real life, a constraint could be: "The cake must
not be burned". In Symfony, constraints are similar: They are assertions that a condition is true.

## Supported Constraints

The following constraints are available:

### String Constraints

* [Json](json.md)

### Number Constraints

* [Bsn](bsn.md)

### Collection Constraints

* [Collection](collection.md)
