Form Field Types Reference

# Form Field Types Reference

A form is composed of fields, each of which are built with the help of a field type (e.g. `TextType`, `ChoiceType`, etc). The
Symfony Add-on Pack comes with additional field types that can be used in your application.

## Supported Field Types

The following field types are available:

### Date and Time Fields

* [BirthdayType](birthday-type.md)

### Other Fields

* [BooleanType](boolean-type.md)
* [EntityType](entity-type.md)
* [UnstructuredType](unstructured-type.md)
